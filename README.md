Temperature variability of a western boundary temperate embayment - UTR analysis of 10 stations in Algoa Bay from 2008 to 2025


The study we present here includes ~15 years of in situ temperature data coupled with satellite data for the observational analysis of sea temperature and variability in Algoa Bay, South Africa, adjacent to the Agulhas Current. We examined spatial and temporal dynamics of thermal structure across multiple scales, including seasonal cycles, interannual variability and extreme events. We highlight the importance of sustained, continuous ocean observation systems in revealing climate driven trends and anomalous events, with the implications for coastal ecosystem response under a rapidly changing ocean. Our work directly demonstrates the usefulness of integrated long-term datasets to monitor and understand ocean temperature variability in a region of global significance. 

In situ temperature data were sourced from the SAEON Observations Database (https://observations.saeon.ac.za/). The data utilised in this study can be viewed on this dashboard (https://googlie.shinyapps.io/SAEON-UTR-static-db/).
